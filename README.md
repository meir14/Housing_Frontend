# Housing App

**Housing App** is a student-centric platform built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, designed to streamline the process of finding roommates and housing. Users can:

- **Sign Up and Log In**: Secure authentication to access personalized features.
- **Create Profiles**: Specify housing preferences and personal details to match with suitable roommates.
- **Browse Listings**: Explore available accommodations tailored to individual needs.
- **Connect and Chat**: Communicate in real-time with potential roommates directly within the app.

By integrating authentication, database management, and real-time messaging, Housing App offers a seamless and efficient housing search experience for students.
